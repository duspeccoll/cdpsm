# Sound Model

The "A Sound Model" project was a grant-funded initiative by the Colorado Digitization Program to digitize and make available oral histories from libraries, archives, and museums from throughout the western United States. For many years it was hosted by the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries through its Alliance Digital Repository; the files are now made available through the University of Denver Libraries and its Islandora repository, [Special Collections @ DU](https://specialcollections.du.edu).

This repository contains scripts used to convert Dublin Core metadata generated by the project to MODS for Islandora ingest, as well as other metadata generated by the project.
